!  WEU v0.5 [beta] - Wave Extraction Utility for OS/2                     !
!_________________________________________________________________________!

   This application was written in my spare time from information
   gathered on various WWW sites.  It will extract .WAV files that
   have been imbeded into other binary files, such as digital still
   images generated with the Kodak DC260 and DC265 cameras.

   This application is fairly straight-forward to use.  Simply run
   WEU.EXE and provide a filename (or list of files) that need to
   be scanned for .WAV information.  Run WEU.EXE without any command-
   line options to get a list of supported switches.

   The initial intent of WEU was to extract sound files imbeded into
   the images generated by the Kodak DC260 and DC265 digital cameras.
